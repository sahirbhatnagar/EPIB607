</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we create a <strong>confidence interval</strong> using a data driven approach known as the bootstrap. The process for creating a confidence interval is based on understanding how a statistic (here the sample proportion) <em>varies</em> around the parameter (here the population proportion) when many different statistics are calculated from many different samples.</p>
<p>If we could, we would measure the variability of the statistics by repeatedly taking sample data from the population and compute the sample proportion.
Then we could do it again.
And again.
And so on until we have a good sense of the variability of our original estimate.</p>
<p>When the variability across the samples is large, we would assume that the original statistic is possibly far from the true population parameter of interest (and the interval estimate will be wide).
When the variability across the samples is small, we expect the sample statistic to be close to the true parameter of interest (and the interval estimate will be narrow).</p>
<p>The ideal world where sampling data is free or extremely cheap is almost never the case, and taking repeated samples from a population is usually impossible.</p>
<p>So, instead of using a “resample from the population” approach, bootstrapping uses a “resample from the sample” approach.
In this chapter we provide examples and details about the bootstrapping process.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping is best suited for modeling studies where the data have been generated through random sampling from a population.</p>
<p>Our goal with bootstrapping is to understand variability of a statistic.</p>
<p>The bootstrap will model how a statistic varies from one sample to another taken from the population.
This will provide information about how different the statistic is from the parameter of interest.</p>
<p>Quantifying the variability of a statistic from sample to sample is a hard problem.</p>
<p>Fortunately, sometimes the mathematical theory for how a statistic varies (across different samples) is known (e.g. through the CLT).</p>
<p>However, some statistics don’t have simple theory for how they vary, and bootstrapping provides a computational approach for providing interval estimates for almost any population parameter.</p>
<p>Our goal with bootstrapping will be to produce an interval estimate (a range of plausible values) for the population parameter.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Medical consultant case study<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#case-study-med-consult"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special medical consultant.
These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery.
Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant’s clients.</p>
<div id="observed-data" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">12.2.1</span> Observed data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#observed-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have had only 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated.
She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).</p>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>We will let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant.
(The “true” complication rate will be referred to as the <strong>parameter</strong>.) We estimate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> using the data, and label the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}.\)</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The sample proportion for the complication rate is 3 complications divided by the 62 surgeries the consultant has worked on: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048.\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>Parameter.</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>parameter</strong> is the “true” value of interest.</p>
<p>We typically estimate the parameter using a point estimate from a sample of data.
The point estimate is also known as the <strong>statistic</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, we estimate the probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of a complication for a client of the medical consultant by examining the past complications rates of her clients:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{p} = 3 / 62 = 0.048~\text{is used to estimate}~p\]</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.2.2</span> Variability of the statistic<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variability-of-the-statistic"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the medical consultant case study, the parameter is <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> the true probability of a complication for a client of the medical consultant.
There is no reason to believe that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is exactly <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 3/62,\)</span> but there is also no reason to believe that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is particularly far from <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 3/62.\)</span>
By sampling with replacement from the dataset (a process called bootstrapping), the variability of the possible <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> values can be approximated.</p>
<p>Most of the inferential procedures covered in this text are grounded in quantifying how one dataset would differ from another when they are both taken from the same population.
It doesn’t make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than separately evaluating two sample of the exact same size.
Instead, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:boot1">12.1</a> shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using the sample to approximate the proportion of successes and failures (in our case, the proportion of complications and no complications for the medical consultant).</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:boot1"></span>
<img src="inst/figures/boot1prop1.png" alt="A small sample of 3 red marbles and 4 white marbles is taken from a large population with predominately unknown individual values.  The sample is then replicated infinitely many times to create a proxy population where the values are known to be 3/7 red and 4/7 white." width="75%"><p class="caption">
Figure 12.1: The unknown population is estimated using the observed sample data. Note that we can use the sample to create an estimated or bootstrapped population from which to sample. The observed data include three red and four white marbles, so the estimated population contains 3/7 red marbles and 4/7 white marbles.
</p>
</div>
<p>By taking repeated samples from the estimated population, the variability from sample to sample can be observed.
In Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:boot2">12.2</a> the repeated bootstrap samples are obviously different both from each other and from the original population.
Recall that the bootstrap samples were taken from the same (estimated) population, and so the differences are due entirely to natural variability in the sampling procedure.</p>

The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> for the example scenario is shown in Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:boot3">12.3</a>, and the full bootstrap distribution for the medical consultant data is shown in Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:MedConsBSSim">12.6</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that in practice, it is very difficult for computers to work with an infinite population (with the same proportional breakdown as in the sample).
However, there is a physical and computational method which produces an equivalent bootstrap distribution of the sample proportion in a computationally efficient manner.</p>
<p>Consider the observed data to be a bag of marbles 3 of which are success (red) and 4 of which are failures (white).
By drawing the marbles out of the bag with replacement, we depict the exact same sampling <strong>process</strong> as was done with the infinitely large estimated population.</p>

</div>
<p>If we apply the bootstrap sampling process to the medical consultant example, we consider each client to be one of the marbles in the bag.
There will be 59 white marbles (no complication) and 3 red marbles (complication).
If we choose 62 marbles out of the bag (one at a time with replacement) and compute the proportion of simulated patients with complications, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot},\)</span> then this “bootstrap” proportion represents a single simulated proportion from the “resample from the sample” approach.</p>
<div class="guidedpractice">
<p>In a simulation of 62 patients, about how many would we expect to have had a complication?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;About 4.8% of the patients (3 on average) in the simulation will have a complication, as this is what was seen in the sample.
We will, however, see a little variation from one simulation to the next.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>One simulation isn’t enough to get a sense of the variability from one bootstrap proportion to another bootstrap proportion, so we repeat the simulation 10,000 times using a computer.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:MedConsBSSim">12.6</a> shows the distribution from the 10,000 bootstrap simulations.
The bootstrapped proportions vary from about zero to 11.3%.
The variability in the bootstrapped proportions leads us to believe that the true probability of complication (the parameter, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) is likely to fall somewhere between 0 and 11.3%, as these numbers capture 95% of the bootstrap resampled values.</p>
<p>The range of values for the true proportion is called a <strong>bootstrap percentile confidence interval</strong>, and we will see it again throughout the next few sections and chapters.</p>

<div class="workedexample">
<p>The original claim was that the consultant’s true rate of complication was under the national rate of 10%.
Does the interval estimate of 0 to 11.3% for the true probability of complication indicate that the surgical consultant has a lower rate of complications than the national average?
Explain.</p>
<hr>
<p>No.
Because the interval overlaps 10%, it might be that the consultant’s work is associated with a lower risk of complications, or it might be that the consultant’s work is associated with a higher risk (i.e., greater than 10%) of complications!
Additionally, as previously mentioned, because this is an observational study, even if an association can be measured, there is no evidence that the consultant’s work is the cause of the complication rate (being higher or lower).</p>

To simulate 120 games, this time we use a bag of 120 marbles 3 are red (for those who guessed correctly) and 117 are white (for those who could not guess the song).
Sampling from the bag 120 times (remembering to replace the marble back into the bag each time to keep constant the population proportion of red) produces one bootstrap sample.</p>
<p>For example, we can start by simulating 5 tapper-listener pairs by sampling 5 marbles from the bag of 3 red and 117 white marbles.</p>

<p>After selecting 120 marbles, we counted 2 red for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot1} = 0.0167.\)</span> As we did with the randomization technique, seeing what would happen with one simulation isn’t enough.
In order to understand how far the observed proportion of 0.025 might be from the true parameter, we should generate more simulations.
Here we’ve repeated the entire simulation ten times:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0.0417 \quad 0.025 \quad 0.025 \quad 0.0083 \quad 0.05 \quad 0.0333 \quad 0.025 \quad 0 \quad 0.0083 \quad 0\]</span> <!-- % round(rbinom(10, 120, 0.5) / 120, 3) --></p>
<p>As before, we’ll run a total of 10,000 simulations using a computer.
As seen in Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:tappers-bs-sim">12.7</a>, the range of 95% of the resampled values of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> is 0.000 to 0.0583.
That is, we expect that between 0% and 5.83% of people are truly able to guess the tapper’s tune.</p>

<p>A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter.
However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate.
In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible <em>range of values</em> for the parameter.</p>

</h3>
<p>A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a <strong>confidence interval</strong>.
Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net.
We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss.
On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.</p>
<p>If we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter.
On the other hand, if we report a range of plausible values – a confidence interval – we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.</p>
<div class="guidedpractice">
<p>If we want to be very certain we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider interval (e.g., 99%) or a smaller interval (e.g., 80%)?<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;If we want to be more certain we will capture the fish, we might use a wider net.

<p>As we saw above, a <strong>bootstrap sample</strong> is a sample of the original sample.
In the case of the medical complications data, we proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomly sample one observation from the 62 patients (replace the marble back into the bag so as to keep the population constant).</li>
<li>Randomly sample a second observation from the 62 patients. Because we sample with replacement (i.e., we don’t actually remove the marbles from the bag), there is a 1-in-62 chance that the second observation will be the same one sampled in the first step!</li>
<li>Keep going one sampled observation at a time …</li>
<li>Randomly sample the 62nd observation from the 62 patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bootstrap sampling is often called <strong>sampling with replacement</strong>.</p>
<p>A bootstrap sample behaves similarly to how an actual sample from a population would behave, and we compute the point estimate of interest (here, compute <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Due to theory that is beyond this text, we know that the bootstrap proportions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> vary around <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> in a similar way to how different sample proportions (i.e., values of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>) vary around the true parameter <span class="math inline">\(p.\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore, an interval estimate for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be produced using the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> values themselves.</p>
<div class="important">
<p><strong>95% Bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a parameter</strong> <span class="math inline">\(p.\)</span></p>
<p>The 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be obtained directly using the ordered <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> values.</p>
<p>Consider the sorted <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{boot}\)</span> values.
Call the 2.5% bootstrapped proportion value “lower”, and call the 97.5% bootstrapped proportion value “upper”.</p>
<p>The 95% confidence interval is given by: (lower, upper)</p>

<p>We can summarize the bootstrap process as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Frame the research question in terms of a parameter to estimate.</strong> Confidence Intervals are appropriate for research questions that aim to estimate a number from the population (called a parameter).</li>
<li>
<strong>Collect data with an observational study or experiment.</strong> If a research question can be formed as a query about the parameter, we can collect data to calculate a statistic which is the best guess we have for the value of the parameter. However, we know that the statistic won’t be exactly equal to the parameter due to natural variability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Model the randomness by using the data values as a proxy for the population.</strong> In order to assess how far the statistic might be from the parameter, we take repeated resamples from the dataset to measure the variability in bootstrapped statistics. The variability of the bootstrapped statistics around the observed statistic (a quantity which can be measured through computational technique) should be approximately the same as the variability of many observed sample statistics around the parameter (a quantity which is very difficult to measure because in real life we only get exactly one sample).</li>
<li>
<strong>Create the interval.</strong> After choosing a particular confidence level, use the variability of the bootstrapped statistics to create an interval estimate which will hope to capture the true parameter. While the interval estimate associated with the particular sample at hand may or may not capture the parameter, the researcher knows that over their lifetime, the confidence level will determine the percentage of their research confidence intervals that do capture the true parameter.</li>
<li>
<strong>Form a conclusion.</strong> Using the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the interval estimate for the parameter of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.</li>
