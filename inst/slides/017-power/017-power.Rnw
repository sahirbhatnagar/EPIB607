\frame{\frametitle{Is this milk watered down?\footnote{\scriptsize{Adapted from Q 15.17 from Moore and McCabe, 4th Edition}}}
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A cheese maker buys milk from several suppliers. It suspects that some suppliers are adding water to their milk to increase their profits.
		\item Excess water can be detected by measuring the freezing point of the liquid. \pause
		\item The freezing temperature of natural milk varies according to a Gaussian distribution, with mean $\mu =  -0.540^{\circ}$ Celsius (C) and standard deviation $\sigma =0.008^{\circ}$C. 
		\item Added water raises the freezing temperature toward $0^{\circ}$C, the freezing point of water. \pause
		\item The laboratory manager measures the freezing temperature of five consecutive lots of `milk' from one supplier. The mean of these 5 measurements is -0.533$^{\circ}$C. \pause
		\item \blue{Question:} Is this good evidence that the producer is adding water to the milk? 
	\end{itemize}
	
	%\textit{Moore and McCabe} asked students to `State hypotheses, carry out the test, give the P -value, and state your conclusion.'

	\begin{itemize}

	determined by the sample size and the chosen Type I error
	rate/significance level. (Therefore, with $\alpha$ fixed at, say
	0.05, the only way to reduce $\beta$ is to increase $n$ or decrease
	$s$.)}

\section{How much water a supplier could add to the milk before they have a 10\% , 50\%, 80\% chance of getting caught, i.e., of the buyer detecting the cheating ?}

\begin{frame}{Statistical Power: the chance of getting caught}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{1em}
		\item We want to know how much water a farmer could add to the milk before they have a 10\% , 50\%, 80\% chance of getting caught (of the buyer detecting the cheating). 
		\item Assume the buyer continues to use an $n=5$, and the same $\sigma =0.008^{\circ}$C, and  bases the boundary for rejecting/accepting the product on a $\alpha = 0.05$, and a 1-sided test which translates to the buyer setting the cutoff at $$-0.540 + 1.645 \times 0.008/\sqrt{5}  = -0.534^{\circ}\textrm{C}.$$
		\item This is equivalent to \texttt{qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = -0.540, sd = 0.008/sqrt(5))}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The cutoff at $\alpha = 0.05$}

		\item Thus, mixtures of 99\% milk and 1\% water  would freeze at a mean of $\mu =  (99/100) \times -0.540^{\circ}C + (1/100) \times 0 ^{\circ}C = -0.5346 ^{\circ} C.$

\section{Assume a 99:1 mix of milk and water. What are the chances of detecting cheating if the buyer uses samples $n$=10, 15 or 20 rather than just 5 measurements?}

\begin{frame}{Power as a function of sample size}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{1em}
		\item Suppose even a 1\% added water is serious, and worth detecting.
		\item Clearly, from the previous Figure, and again at the bottom row of the following Figure,
		one has only a 45\% chance of detecting it: there is a \textbf{large overlap between the sampling distributions under the null (100\% Milk) and the mixture (99\% milk, 1\% water) scenarios}. \pause 
		
		\item So, to better discriminate, one needs to make a bigger resting effort, and measure more lots,
		i.e., increase the $n$.

\begin{frame}{Increasing $n$ leads to increased power}

		\item The larger $n$ narrows and concentrates the sampling distribution. The width is governed by the SD of the sampling distribution of the mean of $n$ measurements, i.e., by the Standard Error of the Mean, or SEM = $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.\pause 
		
		\item Because the null sampling distribution narrows, the cutoff is brought closer to the null.
		And under the alternative (non-null) scenario, a greater portion of its sampling distribution is to
		the right of (i.e., exceeds) the cutoff. \pause 
		
		\item Indeed, under the alternative (i.e., cheating) scenario the probability of exceeding the threshold  is almost 70\% when $n=10,$ 82\% when $n=15$ and 92\% when n=20. \pause

		\item The `balancing formula', in SEM terms, is simply the $n$ where
		$$ 1.645 \times SEM + 0.84 \times SEM = \Delta.$$
		Replacing each of the  SEMs (assumed equal, because we assumed the variability
		is approx. the same under both scenarios) by $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$,  i.e.,
		
		$$ 1.645 \times \sigma/\sqrt{n} + 0.84 \times \sigma/\sqrt{n} = \Delta.$$

		\item In our example, where the \underline{Noise-to-Signal Ratio} is $\frac{\sigma = 0.0080}{\Delta = 0.0054}$ = 1.48, so that its square is $1.48^2$ or approx 2.2,	and $(1.645 + 0.84)^2 = 2.485^2$ = approx 6.2,	$$  n = 6.2  \times 2.2  =  13.6, \textrm{approx, or, rounded up,  } n = \textbf{14}. $$

		i.e,. at - 0.5341.

		mean is above (to right of) -0.540, i.e., on the (upper) 'added water' side of the null. 
		\item Formally, these two hypotheses are 
		$$\textrm{H}_0: \mu = -0.540; \  H_{alt}: \mu > -0.540.$$

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Steps 1 and 2 used to find the power of a one-sided test to detect a difference of $x$ points above (or below) the population mean are similar to the steps for finding the power of a two-sided test to detect a difference of $x$ points on either side of the population mean. 
		\item However for a two-sided test, there will be two sets of values of $\overline{y}$
		that lead us to reject $H_0$ (also, $z_\alpha$ for one-sided and
		$z_{\alpha/2}$ for two-sided).  %\pause
		
		\item \textbf{However}, there is one critical difference in the third step: we need to
		calculate the probability of seeing $\overline{y}$ in either of the two tails (rejection
		regions) of the null distribution under the assumption that the true distribution has
		mean $\mu_A$. So there will be two probabilities to calculate in the third step. 
		\pause
		
		\item Note: If we felt that the minimum significant departure from $\mu_0$
		was different above and below (e.g., we are interested in increases
		of blood pressure of at least 3.5mmHg and decreases of blood
		pressure of at least 2mmHg), we perform the calculations as though
		we were interested in the minimum of the two values (Why?).
