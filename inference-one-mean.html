<p>The important data structure for this chapter is a numeric response variable (that is, the outcome is quantitative).</p>
<p>We will introduce a new important mathematical model, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution (as the foundation for the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test).</p>
<p>In this chapter, we focus on the sample mean (instead of, for example, the sample median or the range of the observations) because of the well-studied mathematical model which describes the behavior of the sample mean.
We will not cover mathematical models which describe other statistics, but the bootstrap and randomization techniques described below are immediately extendable to any function of the observed data.
The sample mean will be calculated in one group, two paired groups, two independent groups, and many groups settings.
The techniques described for each setting will vary slightly, but you will be well served to find the structural similarities across the different settings.</p>
<p>The sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> can also be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.
 However, we’ll soon learn that a new distribution, called the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution, tends to be more useful when working with the sample mean.
We’ll first learn about this new distribution, then we’ll use it to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for the mean.</p>

<p>Consider a situation where you want to know whether you should buy a franchise of the used car store Awesome Autos.
As part of your planning, you’d like to know for how much an average car from Awesome Autos sells.
In order to go through the example more clearly, let’s say that you are only able to randomly sample five cars from Awesome Auto.
(If this were a real example, you would surely be able to take a much larger sample size, possibly even being able to measure the entire population!)</p>

</div>
<p>The sample average car price of $17140.00 is a first guess at the price of the average car price at Awesome Auto.
However, as a student of statistics, you understand that one sample mean based on a sample of five observations will not necessarily equal the true population average car price for all the cars at Awesome Auto.
Indeed, you can see that the observed car prices vary with a standard deviation of $7170.29, and surely the average car price would be different if a different sample of size five had been taken from the population.
Fortunately, as it did in previous chapters for the sample proportion, bootstrapping will approximate the variability of the sample mean from sample to sample.</p>

</h3>
<p>The inferential analysis methods in this chapter are grounded in quantifying how one dataset differs from another when they are both taken from the same population.
To repeat, the idea is that we want to know how datasets differ from one another, but we aren’t ever going to take more than one sample of observations.
It doesn’t make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the ability to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than taking two samples from the population.
Instead of taking repeated samples from the actual population, we use bootstrapping to measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, to get a sense of the cars at Awesome Auto, you take a sample of five cars from the Awesome Auto branch near you as a way to gauge the price of the cars being sold.
Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:bootpop1mean">13.2</a> shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using the sample to approximate the distribution of car prices from the population of cars at Awesome Auto.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:bootpop1mean"></span>
<img src="inst/figures/bootpop1mean.png" alt="The sample of 5 cars is drawn from a large population with other values (i.e., other car prices) unknown. The sample of five cars is replicated infinitely many times to create a proxy population where the car prices are given by the original dataset in the same relative distribution as measured in the sample." width="847"><p class="caption">
Figure 13.2: As seen previously, the idea behind bootstrapping is to consider the sample at hand as an estimate of the population. Sampling from the sample (of 5 cars) is identical to sampling from an infinite population which is made up of only the cars in the original sample.
</p>
</div>
<p>By taking repeated samples from the estimated population, the variability from sample to sample can be observed.
In Figure <a href="foundations-bootstrapping.html#fig:boot2">12.2</a> the repeated bootstrap samples are seen to be different both from each other and from the original population.
Recall that the bootstrap samples were taken from the same (estimated) population, and so the differences in bootstrap samples are due entirely to natural variability in the sampling procedure.
For the situation at hand where the sample mean is the statistic of interest, the variability from sample to sample can be seen in Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:bootsamps1mean">13.3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:bootsamps1mean"></span>
<img src="inst/figures/bootsamps1mean.png" alt="The sample is shown being taken from the large unknown population.

<p>By summarizing each of the bootstrap samples (here, using the sample mean), we see, directly, the variability of the sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y},\)</span> from sample to sample.

A histogram representing many bootstrap resamples indicates that the bootstrap averages vary from roughly 10000 dollars to 25000 dollars." width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 13.4: Because each of the bootstrap resamples respresents a different set of cars, the mean of the each bootstrap resample will be a different value.

<p>Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:carsbsmean">13.5</a> summarizes one thousand bootstrap samples in a histogram of the bootstrap sample means.
The bootstrapped average car prices vary from about $10,000 to $25,000.

<span class="header-section-number">13.2.3</span> Bootstrap SE confidence interval<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bootstrap-se-confidence-interval"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Another method for creating bootstrap confidence intervals directly uses a calculation of the variability of the bootstrap statistics (here, the bootstrap means).
If the bootstrap distribution is relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, then the 95% bootstrap SE confidence interval can be constructed with the formula familiar from the mathematical models in previous chapters:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{point estimate} \pm 2 \cdot SE_{BS}\]</span> or the quantile function. The number 2 is an approximation connected to the “95%” part of the confidence interval (remember the 68-95-99.7 rule).
As will be seen in Section <a href="inference-one-mean.html#one-mean-math">13.3</a>, a new distribution (the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution) will be applied to most mathematical inference on numerical variables.
However, because bootstrapping is not grounded in the same theory as the mathematical approach given in this text, we stick with the standard normal quantiles (in R use the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">qnorm()</a></code> to find normal percentiles other than 95%) for different confidence percentages.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;There is a large literature on understanding and improving bootstrap intervals, see &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Hesterbeg:2015"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; titled &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789"&gt;“What Teachers Should Know About the Bootstrap”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Hayden:2019"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; titled &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1669507"&gt;“Questionable Claims for Simple Versions of the Bootstrap”&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<div class="workedexample">
<p>Explain how the standard error (SE) of the bootstrapped means is calculated and what it is measuring.</p>
<hr>
<p>The SE of the bootstrapped means measures how variable the means are from resample to resample.
The bootstrap SE is a good approximation to the SE of means as if we had taken repeated samples from the original population (which we agreed isn’t something we would do because of wasted resources).</p>
<p>Logistically, we can find the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means using the same calculations from the descriptive statistics section.
That is, the bootstrapped means are the individual observations about which we measure the variability.</p>
</div>
<div class="guidedpractice">
<p>It turns out that the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means from Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:carsbsmean">13.5</a> is $2,891.87 (a value which is an excellent approximation for the standard error of sample means if we were to take repeated samples from the population).
[Note: in R the calculation was done using the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html">sd()</a></code>.] The average of the observed prices is $17,140, ad we will consider the sample average to be the best guess point estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\mu.\)</span> .</p>

We are 95% confident that the true average car price at Awesome Auto is somewhere between $11,356.26 and $22,923.74.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>80</sup></a></p>

However, we are pleased to see that the two methods provide very similar interval approximations.</p>

However, the larger the samples are, the better (and closer) the interval estimates will be.</p>

<p>Using Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:carsbssd">13.6</a>, find <em>and interpret</em> a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the population standard deviation for car prices at Awesome Auto.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;By looking at the percentile values in Figure &lt;a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:carsbssd"&gt;13.6&lt;/a&gt;, the middle 90% of the bootstrap standard deviations are given by the 5 percentile ($3,602.5) and 95 percentile ($8,737.2).
That is, we are 90% confident that the true standard deviation of car prices is between $3,602.5 and $8,737.2.
Note, the problem was set up as 90% to indicate that there was not a need for a high level of confidence (such a 95% or 99%).
A lower degree of confidence increases potential for error, but it also produces a more narrow interval.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>The example presented above is done for a sample with only five observations.
As with analysis techniques that build on mathematical models, bootstrapping works best when a large random sample has been taken from the population.
Bootstrapping is a method for capturing the variability of a statistic when the mathematical model is unknown (it is not a method for navigating small samples).
As you might guess, the larger the random sample, the more accurately that sample will represent the population of interest.</p>

<p>As with the sample proportion, the variability of the sample mean is well described by the mathematical theory given by the Central Limit Theorem.
However, because of missing information about the inherent variability in the population (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>), a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is used in place of the standard normal when performing hypothesis test or confidence interval analyses.</p>

<p>The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu,\)</span> when certain conditions are met.
Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample mean using the population standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n.\)</span></p>

<p><strong>Central Limit Theorem for the sample mean.</strong></p>
<p>When we collect a sufficiently large sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> independent observations from a population with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma,\)</span> the sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> will be nearly normal with</p>

<li>The standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma.\)</span> However, we rarely know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma,\)</span> and instead we must estimate it.

<p>Two conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}:\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Independence.</strong> The sample observations must be independent. The most common way to satisfy this condition is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population.

However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on the rules of thumb.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;More nuanced guidelines would consider further relaxing the &lt;em&gt;particularly extreme outlier&lt;/em&gt; check when the sample size is very large.

<div class="workedexample">
<p>Consider the four plots provided in Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:outliersandsscondition">13.7</a> that come from simple random samples from different populations.
Their sample sizes are <span class="math inline">\(n_1 = 15\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_2 = 50.\)</span></p>
<p>Are the independence and normality conditions met in each case?</p>
<hr>
<p>Each samples is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied.
Let’s next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.</p>
<p>The first sample has very little observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers.
None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram on the right, this gap is small and over 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented to the left of the gap, so we can hardly call these clear outliers.
With no clear outliers, the normality condition can be reasonably assumed to be met.</p>
<p>The second sample has a sample size is larger and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation.
This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied.</p>
<p>It’s often helpful to also visualize the data using a box plot to assess skewness and existence of outliers.
The box plots provided underneath each histogram confirms our conclusions that the first sample does not have any outliers and the second sample does, with one outlier being particularly more extreme than the others.</p>

</div>
<p>In practice, it’s typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe the underlying population would have moderate skew or have particularly extreme outliers beyond what we observe in the data.
For example, consider the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution.
The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is extremely skewed.
When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be satisfied.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> since we do not know the population standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma.\)</span> We encountered a similar issue when computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion, <span class="math inline">\(p.\)</span> Our solution in the proportion context was to use the sample value in place of the population value when computing the standard error.
We’ll employ a similar strategy for computing the standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y},\)</span> using the sample standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in place of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma:\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</span></p>
<p>This strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> accurately.
However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads to problems when using the normal distribution to model <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}.\)</span></p>
<p>We’ll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution.
A <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:tDistCompareToNormalDist">13.8</a>, has a bell shape.
However, its tails are thicker than the normal distribution’s, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution.</p>
<p>The extra thick tails of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem (due to extra variability of the T score) of using <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in place of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> calculation.</p>

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of freedom.
The <strong>degrees of freedom</strong> describes the precise form of the bell-shaped <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution.
Several <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions are shown in Figure <a href="inference-one-mean.html#fig:tDistConvergeToNormalDist">13.9</a> in comparison to the normal distribution.
Similar to the Chi-square distribution, the shape of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution also depends on the degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>In general, we’ll use a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution with <span class="math inline">\(df = n - 1\)</span> to model the sample mean when the sample size is <span class="math inline">\(n.\)</span> That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom will be larger and the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution; when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.</p>

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when analyzing numerical data.
In practice, it’s common to use statistical software, such as R, Python, or SAS for these analyses.
In R, the function used for calculating probabilities under a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution is <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/TDist.html">pt()</a></code> (which should seem similar to previous R functions, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">pnorm()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Chisquare.html">pchisq()</a></code>).
Don’t forget that with the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution, the degrees of freedom must always be specified!</p>
<p>For the examples and guided practices below, you may have to use a table or statistical software to find the answers.
We recommend trying the problems so as to get a sense for how the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution can vary in width depending on the degrees of freedom.

<p>Is the typical US runner getting faster or slower over time?
We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race, which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each spring.
The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.29 minutes (93 minutes and about 17 seconds).
We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower, versus the other possibility that there has been no change.</p>

<p>When completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion.
First, we find the Z score using the observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a <strong>T score</strong> since we use a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution for calculating the tail area.
Then we find the p-value using the same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double it.</p>

<p>With both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis test using the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution.
The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 98.78 and 16.59 minutes, respectively.
Recall that the average run time in 2006 was 93.29 minutes.
Find the test statistic and p-value.
What is your conclusion?</p>
<hr>
<p>To find the test statistic (T score), we first must determine the standard error:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  SE = 16.6 / \sqrt{100} = 1.66 \]</span></p>
<p>Now we can compute the <strong>T score</strong> using the sample mean (98.78), null value (93.29), and <span class="math inline">\(SE:\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ T = \frac{98.8 - 93.29}{1.66} = 3.32 \]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(df = 100 - 1 = 99,\)</span> we can determine using statistical software (or a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-table) that the one-tail area is 0.000631, which we double to get the p-value: 0.00126.</p>
<p>Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is different than the 2006 average.</p>

<p>In this chapter we extended the randomization / bootstrap / mathematical model paradigm to questions involving quantitative variables of interest.
When there is only one variable of interest, we are often hypothesizing or finding confidence intervals about the population mean.
Note, however, the bootstrap method can be used for other statistics like the population median or the population IQR.
When comparing a quantitative variable across two groups, the question often focuses on the difference in population means (or sometimes a paired difference in means).
The questions revolving around one, two, and paired samples of means are addressed using the t-distribution; they are therefore called “t-tests” and “t-intervals.” When considering a quantitative variable across 3 or more groups, a method called ANOVA is applied.
Again, almost all the research questions can be approached using computational methods (e.g., randomization tests or bootstrapping) or using mathematical models.
We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims.
In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation).</p>
