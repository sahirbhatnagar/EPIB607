<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Student Learning Objective</h2>
<p>This section extends the notion of variability that was introduced in
the context of data to other situations. The variability of the entire
<em>population</em> and the concept of a <em>random variable</em> is discussed. These
concepts are central for the development and interpretation of
statistical inference. By the end of the chapter the student should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider the distribution of a variable in a population and compute
parameters of this distribution, such as the mean and the standard
deviation.</p></li>
<li><p>Become familiar with the concept of a random variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the relation between the distribution of the population
and the distribution of a random variable produced by sampling a
random subject from the population.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the distribution of the random variable in simple settings
and compute its expectation and variance.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Different Forms of Variability</h2>
<p>In Section @ref(introdata) we examined the variability in data. In the
statistical context, data is obtained by selecting a sample from the
target population and measuring the quantities of interest for the
subjects that belong to the sample. Different subjects in the sample may
obtain different values for the measurement, leading to variability in
the data.</p>
<p>This variability may be summarized with the aid of a <em>frequency table</em>,
a table of <em>relative frequency</em>, or via the <em>cumulative relative
frequency</em>. A graphical display of the variability in the data may be
obtained with the aid of the <em>bar plot</em>, the <em>histogram</em>, or the <em>boxplot</em>. For example, Figure @ref(fig:frogBoxPlot2) shows a boxplot of <code>clutch.volume</code> (from the <a href="#frogDataExample"><code>frog</code></a> dataset in the <code>oibiostat</code> package) alongside a vertical dot plot.</p>

</div>
<p>Numerical summaries may be computed in order to characterize the main
features of the variability. We used the <em>mean</em> and the <em>median</em> in
order to identify the location of the distribution. The <em>sample
variance</em>, or better yet the <em>sample standard deviation</em>, as well as the
<em>inter-quartile range</em> were all described as tools to quantify the
overall spread of the data.</p>
<p>The aim of all these graphical representations and numerical summaries
is to investigate the variability of the data.</p>
<p>The subject of this chapter is to introduce two other forms of
variability, variability that is not associated, at least not directly,
with the data that we observe. The first type of variability is the
<strong>population variability</strong>. The other type of variability is the
variability of a <strong>random variable</strong>.</p>
<p>The notions of variability that will be presented are abstract, they are
not given in terms of the data that we observe, and they have a
mathematical-theoretical flavor to them. At first, these abstract
notions may look to you as a waste of your time and may seem to be
unrelated to the subject matter of the course. The opposite is true. The
very core of statistical thinking is relating observed data to
theoretical and abstract models of a phenomena. Via this comparison, and
using the tools of statistical inference that are presented in the
second half of the book, statisticians can extrapolate insights or make
statements regarding the phenomena on the basis of the observed data.
Thereby, the abstract notions of variability that are introduced in this
chapter, and are extended in the subsequent chapters, are the essential foundations for the practice of
statistics.</p>
<p>The first notion of variability is the variability that is associated
with the population. It is similar in its nature to the variability of
the data. The difference between these two types of variability is that
the former corresponds to the variability of the quantity of interest
across all members of the population and not only for those that were
selected to the sample.</p>
<p>We will examine the data set <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/blob/master/inst/data/heights_sample.csv"><code>heights_sample.csv</code></a> which contains data on the sex and height of a sample of
100 observations. We will also consider the sex and height of
<em>all</em> the members of the population from which the sample was selected.
The size of the relevant population is 100,000, including the 100
subjects that composed the sample. When we examine the values of the
height across the entire population we can see that different people may
have different heights. This variability of the heights is the
<strong>population variability</strong>.</p>
<p>The other abstract type of variability, the <strong>variability of a random variable</strong>, is a mathematical concept. The aim of this concept is to model
the notion of randomness in measurements or the uncertainty regarding
the outcome of a measurement. In particular we will initially consider
the variability of a random variable in the context of selecting one
subject at random from the population.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a population of size 100,000 and we are about to select
at random one subject from this population. We intend to measure the
height of the subject that will be selected. Prior to the selection and
measurement we are not certain what value of height will be obtained.
One may associate the notion of variability with uncertainty — different
subjects to be selected may obtain different evaluations of the
measurement and we do not know before hand which subject will be
selected. The resulting variability is the variability of a random
variable.</p>
<p>Random variables can be defined for more abstract settings. Their aim is
to provide models for randomness and uncertainty in measurements. Simple
examples of such abstract random variables will be provided in this
chapter. More examples will be introduced in the subsequent chapters.
The more abstract examples of random variables need not be associated
with a specific population. Still, the same definitions that are used
for the example of a random variable that emerges as a result of
sampling a single subject from a population will apply to the more
abstract constructions.</p>
<p>All types of variability, the variability of the data we dealt with
before as well as the other two types of variability, can be displayed
using graphical tools and characterized with numerical summaries.
Essentially the same type of plots and numerical summaries, possibly
with some modifications, may and will be applied.</p>
<p>A point to remember is that the variability of the data relates to a
concrete list of data values that is presented to us. In contrary to the
case of the variability of the data, the other types of variability are
not associated with quantities we actually get to observe. The data for
the sample we get to see but not the data for the rest of the
population. Yet, we can still discuss the variability of a population
that is out there, even though we do not observe the list of
measurements for the entire population. (The example that we give in
this chapter of a population was artificially constructed and serves for
illustration only. In the actual statistical context one does not obtain
measurements from the entire population, only from the subjects that
went into the sample.) The discussion of the variability in this context
is theoretical in its nature. Still, this theoretical discussion is
instrumental for understanding statistics.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Variability of a population</h2>
<p>In this section we introduce the variability of a population and present
some numerical summaries that characterizes this variability. Before
doing so, let us review with the aid of an example some of the numerical
summaries that were used for the characterization of the variability of
data.</p>
<p>Recall the file <code>heights_sample.csv</code> that contains data on the height and sex of
100 subjects (the data file can be obtained <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/blob/master/inst/data/heights_sample.csv">here</a>). We read the
content of the file into a data frame by the name <code>heights_sample</code> and apply the
function <code>summary</code> to the data frame:</p>

<p>When applied to a numeric sequence,
the function <code>summary</code> produces the smallest and largest values in the
sequence, the three quartiles (including the median) and the mean. If
the input of the same function is a factor then the outcome is the
frequency in the data of each of the levels of the factor. Here <code>sex</code>
is a factor with two levels. From the summary we can see that 54 of the
subjects in the sample are female and 46 are male.</p>
<p>Notice that when the input to the function <code>summary</code> is a data frame,
as is the case in this example, then the output is a summary of each of
the variables of the data frame. In this example two of the variables
are numeric (<code>id</code> and <code>height</code>) and one variable is a factor
(<code>sex</code>).</p>
<p>Recall that the mean is the arithmetic average of the data which is
computed by summing all the values of the variable and dividing the
result by the number of observations. Hence, if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of
observations (<span class="math inline">\(n=100\)</span> in this example) and <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the value of the
variable for subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then one may write the mean in a formula form
as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar y = \frac{\mbox{Sum of all values in the data}}{\mbox{Number of values in the data}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n}\;,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\bar y\)</span> corresponds to the mean of the data and the symbol
<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\)</span> corresponds to the sum of all values in the data.</p>
<p>The median is computed by ordering the data values and selecting a value
that splits the ordered data into two equal parts. The first and third
quartile are obtained by further splitting each of the halves into two
quarters.</p>
<p>Let us discuss the variability associated with an entire target
population. The file <code>heights_population.csv</code> that contains the population data can
be obtained <a href="https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/blob/master/inst/data/heights_sample.csv%3E">here</a>. It is a
CSV file that contains the information on sex and height of an entire
adult population of some imaginary city. (The data in <code>heights_sample</code>
corresponds to a sample from this city.) Read the population data into
<code>R</code> and examine it:</p>

<p>The object <code>heights_population</code> is a data frame of the same structure as the data
frame <code>heights_sample</code>. It contains three variables: a unique identifier of each
subject (<code>id</code>), the sex of the subject (<code>sex</code>), and its height
(<code>height</code>). Applying the function <code>summary</code> to the data frame produces
the summary of the variables that it contains. In particular, for the
variable <code>sex</code>, which is a factor, it produces the frequency of its
two categories – 48,888 female and 51,112 – a total of 100,000 subjects.
For the variable <code>height</code>, which is a numeric variable, it produces
the extreme values, the quartiles, and the mean.</p>

<p class="caption">
(#fig:Prob1)Bar Plot of Height
</p>
</div>
<p>Let us concentrate on the variable <code>height</code>. A bar plot of the
distribution of the heights in the entire population is given in
Figure @ref(fig:Prob1). Recall that a vertical bar is placed
above each value of height that appears in the population, with the
height of the bar representing the frequency of the value in the
population. One may read out of the graph or obtain from the numerical
summaries that the variable takes integer values in the range between
117 and 217 (heights are rounded to the nearest centimeter). The
distribution is centered at 170 centimeter, with the central 50% of the
values spreading between 162 and 178 centimeters.</p>
<p>The mean of the height in the entire population is equal to 170
centimeter. This mean, just like the mean for the distribution of data,
is obtained by the summation of all the heights in the population
divided by the population size. Let us denote the size of the entire
population by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In this example <span class="math inline">\(N = 100,000\)</span>. (The size of the
sample for the data was called <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and was equal to <span class="math inline">\(n=100\)</span> in the
parallel example that deals with the data of a sample.) The mean of an
entire population is denoted by the Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and is read
“<em>mew</em>”. (The average for the data was denoted <span class="math inline">\(\bar y\)</span>). The formula of
the population mean is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu = \frac{\mbox{Sum of all values in the population}}{\mbox{Number of values in the population}}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N y_i}{N}\;.\]</span></p>
<p>Observe the similarity between the definition of the mean for the data
and the definition of the mean for the population. In both cases the
arithmetic average is computed. The only difference is that in the case
of the mean of the data the computation is with respect to the values
that appear in the sample whereas for the population all the values in
the population participate in the computation.</p>
<div class="rmdwarning">
<p>In actual life, we will not have all the values of a variable in the
entire population. Hence, we will not be able to compute the actual
value of the population mean.</p>
</div>
<p>However, it is still meaningful to talk
about the population mean because this number exists, even though we do
not know what its value is. As a matter of fact, <em>one of the issues in statistics is to try to estimate this unknown quantity on the basis of the data we do have in the sample</em>.</p>
<p>A characteristic of the distribution of an entire population is called a
<strong>parameter</strong>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the population average, is a parameter. Other
examples of parameters are the population median and the population
quartiles. These parameters are defined exactly like their data
counterparts, but with respect to the values of the entire population
instead of the observations in the sample alone. See Section @ref(paras) for more details on statistical parameters.</p>
<p>Another example of a parameter is the population variance. Recall that
the sample variance was defined with the aid of the deviations
<span class="math inline">\(y_i - \bar y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the value of the measurement for the
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th subject and <span class="math inline">\(\bar y\)</span> is the mean for the data. In order to compute
the sample variance these deviations were squared to produce the squared
deviations. The squares were summed up and then divided by the sample
size minus one (<span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>). The sample variance, computed from the data, was
denoted <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The population variance is defined in a similar way. First, the
deviations from the population mean <span class="math inline">\(y_i - \mu\)</span> are considered for each
of the members of the population. These deviations are squared and the
average of the squares is computed. We denote this parameter by
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> (read “<em>sigma square</em>”). A minor difference between the
sample variance and the population variance is that for the latter we
should divide the sum of squared deviations by the population size (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>)
and not by the population size minus one (<span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 =&amp; \mbox{The average square deviation in the population}\\
         =&amp; \frac{\mbox{Sum of the squares of the deviations in the population}}{\mbox{Number of values in the population}}\\
         =&amp; \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-\mu)^2}{N}\;.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The standard deviation of the population, yet another parameter, is
denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and is equal to the square root of the variance. The
standard deviation summarizes the overall variability of the measurement
across the population. Again, the typical situation is that we do not
know what the actual value of the standard deviation of the population
is. Yet, we may refer to it as a quantity and we may try to estimate its
value based on the data we do have from the sample.</p>
<p>For the height of the subjects in our imaginary city we get that the
variance is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 =126.1576\)</span>. The standard deviation is
equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \sqrt{126.1576} = 11.23199\)</span>. These quantities can be
computed in this example from the data frame <code>heights_population</code> with the aid of
the functions <code>var</code> and <code>sd</code>, respectively<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Variability of a random variable</h2>
<p>In the previous section we dealt with the variability of the population.
Next we consider the variability of a random variable. As an example,
consider taking a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> from the population (a single
person) and measuring his/her height. We will apply the function <code>dplyr::sample_n</code> to sample one row from the data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>heights_population <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  dplyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">sample_n</span>(<span class="at">size =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##        id  sex height
## 1 5316176 MALE    179</code></pre>
<p>The first entry to the function is the data frame. When
we set the second argument to <code>size = 1</code> then the function selects one of the
entries of the data frame at random, with each entry having the same
likelihood of being selected. Let us run the function again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>heights_population <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  dplyr<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">sample_n</span>(<span class="at">size =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##        id  sex height
## 1 1829578 MALE    174</code></pre>
<p>In this instance an entry with a different value was selected. Try to
run the command several times yourself and see what you get. Would you
necessarily obtain a different value in each run?</p>
<p>Now let us enter the same command without pressing the return key:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>heights_population <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

<p>Can you tell, before pressing the key, what value will you get?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is of course <em>“No”</em>. There are 100,000
entries. In principle, any of the
values may be selected and there is no way of telling in advance which
of the values will turn out as an outcome.</p>
<p>A random variable is the future outcome of a measurement, <span><strong>before</strong></span>
the measurement is taken. It does not have a specific value, but rather
a collection of potential values with a distribution over these values.</p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p>After the measurement is taken and the specific value is revealed then
the random variable ceases to be a random variable! Instead, it becomes
data.</p>
</div>
<p>Although one is not able to say what the outcome of a random variable
will turn out to be. Still, one may identify patterns in this potential
outcome. For example, knowing that the distribution of heights in the
population ranges between 117 and 217 centimeter one may say in advance
that the outcome of the measurement must also be in that interval.
Moreover, since there is a total of 3,476 subjects with height equal to
168 centimeters and since the likelihood of each subject to be selected
is equal then the likelihood of selecting a subject of this height is
3,476/100,000 = 0.03476. In the context of random variables we call this
likelihood <strong>probability</strong>. In the same vain, the frequency of subjects
with hight 192 centimeter is 488, and therefore the probability of
measuring such a height is 0.00488. The frequency of subjects with
height 200 centimeter or above is 393, hence the probability of
obtaining a measurement in the range between 200 and 217 centimeter is
0.00393.</p>
<div id="sample-space-and-distribution" class="section level3" number="1.4.1">

</div>
<p>A random variable is characterized via the collection of potential
values it may obtain, known as the <strong>sample space</strong> and the likelihood of
obtaining each of the values in the sample space (namely, the
probability of the value). In the given example, the sample space
contains the 94 integer values that are marked in
Figure @ref(fig:Prob1). The probability of each value is the height
of the bar above the value, divided by the total frequency of 100,000
(namely, the relative frequency in the population).</p>
<p>We will denote random variables with capital Latin letters such as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. Values they may obtain will be marked by small Latin
letters such as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. For the probability of values we will use
the letter “<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}\)</span>”. Hence, if we denote by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the measurement of
height of a random individual that is sampled from the given population
then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{P}(Y = 168) = 0.03476\]</span> and
<span class="math display">\[\operatorname{P}(Y \geq 200) = 0.00393\;.\]</span></p>
<p>Consider, as yet another example, the probability that the height of a
random person sampled from the population differs from 170 centimeter by
no more than 10 centimeters. (In other words, that the height is between
160 and 180 centimeters.) Denote by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the height of that random
person. We are interested in the probability
<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(|Y -170| \leq 10)\)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The random person can be any of the subjects of the population with
equal probability. Thus, the sequence of the heights of the 100,000
subjects represents the distribution of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Y <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> heights_population<span class="sc">$</span>height</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that the object <code>Y</code> is a sequence of length 100,000 that stores
all the heights of the population. The probability we seek is the
relative frequency in this sequence of values between 160 and 180. First
we compute the probability and then explain the method of computation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mean</span>(<span class="fu">abs</span>(Y<span class="dv">-170</span>) <span class="sc">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">10</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.64541</code></pre>
<p>We get that the height of a person randomly sampled from the population
is between 160 and 180 centimeters with probability 0.64541.</p>
<p>Let us produce a small example that will help us explain the computation
of the probability. We start by forming a sequence with 10 numbers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Y <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="fl">6.3</span>, <span class="fl">6.9</span>, <span class="fl">6.6</span>, <span class="fl">3.4</span>, <span class="fl">5.5</span>, <span class="fl">4.3</span>, <span class="fl">6.5</span>, <span class="fl">4.7</span>, <span class="fl">6.1</span>, <span class="fl">5.3</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The goal is to compute the proportion of numbers that are in the range
<span class="math inline">\([4,6]\)</span> (or, equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(\{|Y-5| \leq 1\}\)</span>).</p>
<p>The function <code>abs</code> computes the absolute number of its input argument.
When the function is applied to the sequence <code>Y-5</code> it produces a
sequence of the same length with the distances between the components of
<code>Y</code> and the number 5:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">abs</span>(Y<span class="dv">-5</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] 1.3 1.9 1.6 1.6 0.5 0.7 1.5 0.3 1.1 0.3</code></pre>
<p>Compare the resulting output to the original sequence. The first value
in the input sequence is 6.3. Its distance from 5 is indeed 1.3. The
fourth value in the input sequence is 3.4. The difference 3.4 - 5 is
equal to -1.6, and when the absolute value is taken we get a distance of
1.6.</p>
<p>The function <code>&lt;=</code> expects an argument to the right and an argument to
the left. It compares each component to the left with the parallel
component to the right and returns a logical value, <code>TRUE</code> or
<code>FALSE</code>, depending on whether the relation that is tested holds or
not:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">abs</span>(Y <span class="sc">-</span> <span class="dv">5</span>) <span class="sc">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE</code></pre>
<p>Observe the in this example the function <code>&lt;=</code> produced 10 logical
values, one for each of the elements of the sequence to the left of it.
The first input in the sequence <code>Y</code> is 6.3, which is more than one
unit away from 5. Hence, the first output of the logical expression is
<code>FALSE</code>. On the other hand, the last input in the sequence <code>Y</code> is
5.3, which is within the range. Therefore, the last output of the
logical expression is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we compute the proportion of <code>TRUE</code> values in the sequence:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mean</span>(<span class="fu">abs</span>(Y <span class="sc">-</span> <span class="dv">5</span>) <span class="sc">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.4</code></pre>
<p>When a sequence with logical values is entered into the function
<code>mean</code> then the function replaces the <code>TRUE</code>’s by 1 and the <code>FALSE</code>’s
by 0. The average produces then the relative frequency of <code>TRUE</code>’s in
the sequence as required. Specifically, in this example there are 4
<code>TRUE</code>’s and 6 <code>FALSE</code>’s. Consequently, the output of the final
expression is <span class="math inline">\(4/10 = 0.4\)</span>.</p>
<p>The computation of the probability that the sampled height falls within
10 centimeter of 170 is based on the same code. The only differences are
that the input sequence <code>Y</code> is replaced by the sequence of population
heights <code>Y</code> as input. the number <code>5</code> is replaced by the number
<code>170</code> and the number <code>1</code> is replaced by the number <code>10</code>. In both
cases the result of the computation is the relative proportion of the
times that the values of the input sequence fall within a given range of
the indicated number.</p>
<p>The probability function of a random variable is defined for any value
that the random variable may obtain and produces the <strong>distribution</strong> of
the random variable. The probability function may emerge as a relative
frequency as in the given example or it may be a result of theoretical
modeling. Examples of theoretical random variables are presented in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p>Consider an example of a random variable. The sample space and the
probability function specify the distribution of the random variable.
For example, assume it is known that a random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> may obtain
the values 0, 1, 2, or 3. Moreover, imagine that it is known that
<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(Y=1) = 0.25\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(Y=2) = 0.15\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(Y=3)= 0.10\)</span>. What
is <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(Y=0)\)</span>, the probability that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is equal to 0?</p>
<p>The sample space, the collection of possible values that the random
variable may obtain is the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3\}\)</span>. Observe that the
sum over the positive values is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{P}(Y &gt; 0) = \operatorname{P}(Y=1) + \operatorname{P}(Y=2) + \operatorname{P}(Y=3) = 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 0.50\;.\]</span>
It follows, since the sum of probabilities over the entire sample space
is equal to 1, that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(Y=0) = 1- 0.5 = 0.5\)</span>.</p>

<p>Table @ref(tab:Probability1) summarizes the distribution of the random
variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Observe the similarity between the probability function
and the notion of relative frequency that was discussed in
Section @ref(introdata). Both quantities describe distribution. Both are
non-negative and sum to 1. Likewise, notice that one may define the
cumulative probability the same way cumulative relative frequency is
defined: Ordering the values of the random variable from smallest to
largest, the cumulative probability at a given value is the sum of
probabilities for values less or equal to the given value.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the probabilities of a random variable (or the cumulative
probabilities) enables the computation of other probabilities that are
associated with the random variable. For example, considering the random
variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> of Table @ref(tab:Probability1), we may calculate the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> falling in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0.5, 2.3]\)</span>. Observe that
the given range contains two values from the sample space, 1 and 2,
therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{P}(0.5 \leq Y \leq 2.3) = \operatorname{P}(Y=1) + \operatorname{P}(Y = 2) = 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.40\;.\]</span>
Likewise, we may produce the probability of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> obtaining an odd value:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{P}(Y = \mbox{odd}) = \operatorname{P}(Y=1) + \operatorname{P}(Y=3) = 0.25 + 0.10 = 0.35\;.\]</span>
Observe that both <span class="math inline">\(\{0.5 \leq Y \leq 2.3\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{Y = \mbox{odd}\}\)</span>
refer to subsets of values of the sample space. Such subsets are denoted
<strong>events</strong>. In both examples the probability of the event was computed by
the summation of the probabilities associated with values that belong to
the event.</p>
</div>
<div id="expectation-and-standard-deviation" class="section level3" number="1.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Expectation and Standard Deviation</h3>
<p>We may characterize the center of the distribution of a random variable
and the spread of the distribution in ways similar to those used for the
characterization of the distribution of data and the distribution of a
population.</p>
<p>The <strong>expectation</strong> marks the center of the distribution of a random
variable. It is equivalent to the data average <span class="math inline">\(\bar y\)</span> and the
population average <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, which was used in order to mark the location
of the distribution of the data and the population, respectively.</p>
<p>The average of the data can be computed as the weighted average of the values that are present
in the data, with weights given by the relative frequency. Specifically,
for the data</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[1,\; 1,\; 1,\; 2,\; 2,\; 3,\; 4,\; 4,\; 4,\; 4,\; 4,\]</span> the mean can be calculated via</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4}{11} =
1\times \frac{3}{11} + 2 \times \frac{2}{11} + 3 \times \frac{1}{11} + 4 \times \frac{5}{11}\;,\]</span>
producing the value of <span class="math inline">\(\bar y =2.727\)</span> in both representations. Using a
formula, the equality between the two ways of computing the mean is
given in terms of the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar y = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n} = \sum_y \big(y \times (f_y/n)\big)\;,\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(f_y/n\)</span> represents the frequency of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in the data.
In the first representation of the arithmetic mean, the average is
computed by the summation of all data points and dividing the sum by the
sample size. In the second representation, that uses a weighted sum, the
sum extends over all the unique values that appear in the data. For each
unique value the value is multiplied by the relative frequency of the
value in the data. These multiplications are summed up to produce the
mean.</p>
<p>The expectation of a random variable is computed in the spirit of the
second formulation. The expectation of a random variable is marked with
the letter “<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{E}\)</span>” and is define via the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{E}(Y) = \sum_y \big(y \times \operatorname{P}(y)\big)\;.\]</span> In this definition
all the unique values of the sample space are considered. For each value
a product of the value and the probability of the value is taken. The
expectation is obtained by the summation of all these products. In this
definition the probability <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{P}(y)\)</span> replaces the relative frequency
<span class="math inline">\(f_y/n\)</span> but otherwise, the definition of the expectation and the second
formulation of the mean are identical to each other.</p>
<p>Consider the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with distribution that is described in
Table @ref(tab:Probability1). In order to obtain its expectation we
multiply each value in the sample space by the probability of the value.
Summation of the products produces the expectation (see
Table @ref(tab:Probability1):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{E}(Y) = 0 \times 0.5 + 1 \times 0.25 + 2 \times 0.15 + 3\times 0.10 = 0.85\;.\]</span></p>

<p>In the example of height we get that the expectation is equal to 170.035
centimeter. Notice that this expectation is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the mean of
the population<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. This is no accident. The expectation of a potential
measurement of a randomly selected subject from a population is equal to
the average of the measurement across all subjects.</p>
<p>The sample variance (<span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>) is obtained as the sum of the squared
deviations from the average, divided by the sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) minus 1:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar y)^2}{n-1}\;.\]</span> A second
formulation for the computation of the same quantity is via the use of
relative frequencies. The formula for the sample variance takes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s^2 = \frac{n}{n-1}\sum_y \big((y - \bar y)^2\times (f_y/n)\big)\;.\]</span>
In this formulation one considers each of the unique value that are
present in the data. For each value the deviation between the value and
the average is computed. These deviations are then squared and
multiplied by the relative frequency. The products are summed up.
Finally, the sum is multiplied by the ratio between the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> in order to correct for the fact that in the sample variance
the sum of squared deviations is divided by the sample size minus 1 and
not by the sample size.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the variance of a random variable may be defined via
the probability of the values that make the sample space. For each such
value one computes the deviation from the expectation. This deviation is
then squared and multiplied by the probability of the value. The
multiplications are summed up in order to produce the variance:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \sum_y\big( (y-\operatorname{E}(Y))^2 \times \operatorname{P}(y)\big)\;.\]</span> Notice
that the formula for the computation of the variance of a random
variable is very similar to the second formulation for the computation
of the sample variance. Essentially, the mean of the data is replaced by
the expectation of the random variable and the relative frequency of a
value is replaced by the probability of the value. Another difference is
that the correction factor is not used for the variance of a random
variable.</p>

<p>As an example consider the variance of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The
computation of the variance of this random variable is carried out in
Table @ref(tab:tab3). The sample space, the values that the
random variable may obtain, are given in the first column and the
probabilities of the values are given in the second column. In the third
column the deviation of the value from the expectation
<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{E}(Y) = 0.85\)</span> is computed for each value. The 4th column contains
the square of these deviations and the 5th and last column involves the
product of the square deviations and the probabilities. The variance is
obtained by summing up the products in the last column. In the given
example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Var}(Y) = &amp; (0-0.85)^2 \times 0.5  + (1-0.85)^2 \times 0.25 \\ &amp;+ (2-0.85)^2\times 0.15 + (3-0.85)^2\times 0.10= 1.0275\;.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The standard deviation of a random variable is the square root of the
variance. The standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(Y)} = \sqrt{1.0275} = 1.013657\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the example that involves the height of a subject selected from the
population at random we obtain that the variance is <span class="math inline">\(126.1576\)</span>, equal to
the population variance, and the standard deviation is 11.23199, the
square root of the variance.</p>
<p>Other characterization of the distribution that were computed for data,
such as the median, the quartiles, etc., may also be defined for random
variables.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Probability and Statistics</h2>
<p>Modern science may be characterized by a systematic collection of
empirical measurements and the attempt to model laws of nature using
mathematical language. The drive to deliver better measurements led to
the development of more accurate and more sensitive measurement tools.
Nonetheless, at some point it became apparent that measurements may not
be perfectly reproducible and any repeated measurement of presumably the
exact same phenomena will typically produce variability in the outcomes.
On the other hand, scientists also found that there are general laws
that govern this variability in repetitions. For example, it was
discovered that the average of several independent repeats of the
measurement is less variable and more reproducible than each of the
single measurements themselves.</p>
<p>Probability was first introduced as a branch of mathematics in the
investigation of uncertainty associated with gambling and games of
chance. During the early 19th century probability began to be used in
order to model variability in measurements. This application of
probability turned out to be very successful. Indeed, one of the major
achievements of probability was the development of the mathematical
theory that explains the phenomena of reduced variability that is
observed when averages are used instead of single measurements. In
the following chapters we discuss the conclusions of this theory.</p>
<p>Statistics study methods for inference based on data. Probability serves
as the mathematical foundation for the development of statistical
theory. In this chapter we introduced the probabilistic concept of a
random variable. This concept is key for understanding statistics. We will next discuss the probability theory that is used for statistical inference. Statistical inference itself is
discussed later on in the course.</p>
