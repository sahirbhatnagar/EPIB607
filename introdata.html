<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Case Study: preventing peanut allergies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#leapCaseStudy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The proportion of young children in Western countries with peanut allergies has doubled in the last 10 years. Previous research suggests that exposing infants to peanut-based foods, rather than excluding such foods from their diets, may be an effective strategy for preventing the development of peanut allergies. The <em>Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP)</em> study was conducted to investigate whether early exposure to peanut products reduces the probability that a child will develop peanut allergies.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;George Du Toit et al., “Randomized Trial of Peanut Consumption in Infants at Risk for Peanut Allergy,” &lt;em&gt;N Engl J Med&lt;/em&gt; 372 (2015): 803–13.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The study team enrolled children in the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2009, selecting 640 infants with eczema, egg allergy, or both. Each child was randomly assigned to either the peanut consumption (treatment) group or the peanut avoidance (control) group. Children in the treatment group were fed at least 6 grams of peanut protein daily until 5 years of age, while children in the control group avoided consuming peanut protein until 5 years of age.</p>
<p>At 5 years of age, each child was tested for peanut allergy using an oral food challenge (OFC): 5 grams of peanut protein in a single dose. A child was recorded as passing the oral food challenge if no allergic reaction was detected, and failing the oral food challenge if an allergic reaction occurred. These children had previously been tested for peanut allergy through a skin test, conducted at the time of study entry; the main analysis presented in the paper was based on data from 530 children with an earlier negative skin test. Although a total of 542 children had an earlier negative skin test, data collection did not occur for 12 children.</p>
<p>Individual-level data from the study are shown in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:leapStudyResultsDF">1.1</a>. Each row represents a participant and shows the participant’s study ID number, treatment group assignment, and OFC outcome. The data are available as from the <code>oibiostat</code> R package.</p>

<p>The summary Table <a href="introdata.html#tab:leapStudyResults">1.1</a> makes it easier to identify patterns in the data. Recall that the question of interest is whether children in the peanut consumption group are more or less likely to develop peanut allergies than those in the peanut avoidance group. In the avoidance group, the proportion of children failing the OFC is <span class="math inline">\(36/263 = 0.137\)</span> (13.7%); in the consumption group, the proportion of children failing the OFC is <span class="math inline">\(5/267 = 0.019\)</span> (1.9%). Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:leapBarPlot">1.2</a> shows a graphical method of displaying the study results, using either the number of individuals per category from Table <a href="introdata.html#tab:leapStudyResults">1.1</a> or the proportion of individuals with a specific OFC outcome in a group.</p>

<p>The proportion of participants failing the OFC is 11.8% higher in the peanut avoidance group than the peanut consumption group. Another way to summarize the data is to compute the ratio of the two proportions (0.137/0.019 = 7.31), and conclude that the proportion of participants failing the OFC in the avoidance group is more than 7 times as large as in the consumption group; i.e., the risk of failing the OFC was more than 7 times as great for participants in the avoidance group relative to the consumption group.</p>
<p>Based on the results of the study, it seems that early exposure to peanut products may be an effective strategy for reducing the chances of developing peanut allergies later in life. It is important to note that this study was conducted in the United Kingdom at a single site of pediatric care; it is not clear that these results can be generalized to other countries or cultures.</p>
<p>The results also raise an important statistical issue: does the study provide definitive evidence that peanut consumption is beneficial? In other words, is the 11.8% difference between the two groups larger than one would expect by chance variation alone? The material on inference in later chapters will provide the statistical tools to evaluate this question.</p>

<p>In evolutionary biology, parental investment refers to the amount of time, energy, or other resources devoted towards raising offspring. This section introduces the <code>frog</code> dataset, which originates from a 2013 study about maternal investment in a frog species.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;W Chen et al., “Maternal Investment Increases with Altitude in a Frog on the Tibetan Plateau,” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&lt;/em&gt; 26, no. 12 (2013): 2710–5.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Reproduction is a costly process for female frogs, necessitating a trade-off between individual egg size and total number of eggs produced. Researchers were interested in investigating how maternal investment varies with altitude and collected measurements on egg clutches found at breeding ponds across 11 study sites; for 5 sites, the body size of individual female frogs was also recorded.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogDF">1.3</a> displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 150 of the data from the 431 clutches
observed as part of the study. The <code>frog</code> dataset is available from the <code>oibiostat</code> R package. Each row in the table corresponds to a single clutch, indicating where the clutch was collected (<code>altitude</code> and <code>latitude</code>), <code>egg.size</code>, <code>clutch.size</code>, <code>clutch.volume</code>, and <code>body.size</code> of the mother when available. An empty cell corresponds to a missing value, indicating that information on an individual female was not collected for that particular clutch. The recorded characteristics are referred to as <strong>variables</strong>; in this table, each column represents a variable.</p>

<p>It is important to check the definitions of variables, as they are not always obvious. For example, why has <code>clutch.size</code> not been recorded as whole numbers? For a given clutch, researchers counted approximately 5 grams’ worth of eggs and then estimated the total number of eggs based on the mass of the entire clutch. Definitions of the variables are given in the Table above.</p>
<p>The data in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogDF">1.3</a> form a <strong>data frame</strong> and, in this example, are organized in <strong>tidy format</strong>. Each row of a tidy data frame corresponds to an observational unit, and each column corresponds to a variable. A piece of the data frame for the LEAP study introduced in Section <a href="introdata.html#leapCaseStudy">1.1</a> is shown in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:leapStudyResultsDF">1.1</a>; the rows are study participants and three variables are shown for each participant. Tidy data frames are a convenient way to record and store data. If the data are collected for another individual, another row can easily be added; similarly, another column can be added for a new variable.</p>

<p>The variables <code>age</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>weight</code>, and <code>ndrm.ch</code> are <strong>numerical variables</strong>. They take on numerical values, and it is reasonable to add, subtract, or take averages with these values. In contrast, a variable reporting telephone numbers would not be classified as numerical, since sums, differences, and averages in this context have no meaning. Age measured in years is said to be <strong>discrete</strong>, since it can only take on numerical values with jumps; i.e., positive integer values. Percent change in strength in the non-dominant arm (<code>ndrm.ch</code>) is <strong>continuous</strong>, and can take on any value within a specified range.</p>
<p>The variables <code>sex</code>, <code>race</code>, and <code>actn3.r577x</code> are <strong>categorical variables</strong>, which take on values that are names or labels. The possible values of a categorical variable are called the variable’s <strong>levels</strong>. For example, the levels of <code>actn3.r577x</code> are the three possible genotypes at this particular locus: CC, CT, or TT. Categorical variables without a natural ordering are called <strong>nominal categorical variables</strong>; <code>sex</code>, <code>race</code>, and <code>actn3.r577x</code> are all nominal categorical variables. Categorical variables with levels that have a natural ordering are referred to as <strong>ordinal categorical variables</strong>. For example, age of the participants grouped into 5-year intervals (15-20, 21-25, 26-30, etc.) is an ordinal categorical variable.</p>

<p>Many studies are motivated by a researcher examining how two or more variables are related. For example, do the values of one variable increase as the values of another decrease? Do the values of one variable tend to differ by the levels of another variable?</p>
<p>One study used the <code>famuss</code> data to investigate whether ACTN3 genotype at a particular location (residue 577) is associated with change in muscle strength. The ACTN3 gene codes for a protein involved in muscle function. A common mutation in the gene at a specific location changes the cytosine (C) nucleotide to a thymine (T) nucleotide; individuals with the TT genotype are unable to produce any ACTN3 protein.</p>
<p>Researchers hypothesized that genotype at this location might influence muscle function. As a measure of muscle function, they recorded the percent change in non-dominant arm strength after strength training; this variable, <code>ndrm.ch</code>, is the <strong>response variable</strong> in the study. A response variable is defined by the particular research question a study seeks to address, and measures the outcome of interest in the study. A study will typically examine whether the values of a response variable differ as values of an <strong>explanatory variable</strong> change, and if so, how the two variables are related. A given study may examine several explanatory variables for a single response variable. The explanatory variable examined in relation to <code>ndrm.ch</code> in the study is <code>actn3.r557x</code>, ACTN3 genotype at location 577.</p>

<p>Consider the following research questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do bluefin tuna from the Atlantic Ocean have particularly high levels of mercury, such that they are unsafe for human consumption?<br>
</li>
<li>For infants predisposed to developing a peanut allergy, is there evidence that introducing peanut products early in life is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of developing a peanut allergy?<br>
</li>
<li>Does a recently developed drug designed to treat glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, appear more effective at inducing tumor shrinkage than the drug currently on the market?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these questions refers to a specific target <strong>population</strong>. For example, in the first question, the target population consists of all bluefin tuna from the Atlantic Ocean; each individual bluefin tuna represents a case. It is almost always either too expensive or logistically impossible to collect data for every case in a population. As a result, nearly all research is based on information obtained about a sample from the population. A <strong>sample</strong> represents a small fraction of the population. Researchers interested in evaluating the mercury content of bluefin tuna from the Atlantic Ocean could collect a sample of 500 bluefin tuna (or some other quantity), measure the mercury content, and use the observed information to formulate an answer to the research question.</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence typically refers to unusual observations that are easily recalled because of their striking characteristics. Physicians may be more likely to remember the characteristics of a single patient with an unusually good response to a drug instead of the many patients who did not respond. The dangers of drawing general conclusions from anecdotal information are obvious; no single observation should be used to draw conclusions about a population.</p>
<p>While it is incorrect to generalize from individual observations, unusual observations can sometimes be valuable. E.C. Heyde was a general practitioner from Vancouver who noticed that a few of his elderly patients with aortic-valve stenosis (an abnormal narrowing) caused by an accumulation of calcium had also suffered massive gastrointestinal bleeding. In 1958, he published his observation.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;EC Heyde, “Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Aortic Stenosis,” &lt;em&gt;N Engl J Med&lt;/em&gt; 259 (1958): 196.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a></span> Further research led to the identification of the underlying cause of the association, now called Heyde’s Syndrome.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Robert J Greenstein et al., “Colonic Vascular Ectasias and Aortic Stenosis: Coincidence or Causal Relationship?” &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Surgery&lt;/em&gt; 151, no. 3 (1986): 347–51.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<p>An anecdotal observation can never be the basis for a conclusion, but may well inspire the design of a more systematic study that could be definitive.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Sampling from a population<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-from-a-population"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Sampling from a population, when done correctly, provides reliable information about the characteristics of a large population. The US Centers for Disease Control (US CDC) conducts several surveys to obtain information about the US population, including the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html" class="uri">https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html</a>). The BRFSS was established in 1984 to collect data about health-related risk behaviors, and now collects data from more than 400,000 telephone interviews conducted each year. The CDC conducts similar surveys for diabetes, health care access, and immunization. Likewise, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducts the World Health Survey in partnership with approximately 70 countries to learn about the health of adult populations and the health systems in those countries (<a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/" class="uri">http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/</a>).</p>
<p>The general principle of sampling is straightforward: a sample from a population is useful for learning about a population only when the sample is representative of the population. In other words, the characteristics of the sample should correspond to the characteristics of the population.</p>
<p>Suppose that the quality improvement team at an integrated health care system, such as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, is interested in learning about how members of the health plan perceive the quality of the services offered under the plan. A common pitfall in conducting a survey is to use a convenience sample, in which individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample than other individuals. If a sample were collected by approaching plan members visiting an outpatient clinic during a particular week, the sample would fail to enroll generally healthy members who typically do not use outpatient services or schedule routine physical examinations; this method would produce an unrepresentative sample (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:sampleConvenienceHealthPlan">1.6</a>).</p>
<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>
<p>Random sampling is the best way to ensure that a sample reflects a population. In a <strong>simple random sample (SRS)</strong>, each member of a population has the same chance of being sampled. One way to achieve a simple random sample of the health plan members is to randomly select a certain number of names from the complete membership roster, and contact those individuals for an interview (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:sampleRandomHealthPlan">1.7</a>).</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:sampleRandomHealthPlan"></span>

Figure 1.7: Five members are randomly selected from the population to be interviewed.
</p>
</div>
<p>Even when a simple random sample is taken, it is not guaranteed that the sample is representative of the population. If the <strong>non-response</strong> rate for a survey is high, that may be indicative of a biased sample. Perhaps a majority of participants did not respond to the survey because only a certain group within the population is being reached; for example, if questions assume that participants are fluent in English, then a high non-response rate would be expected if the population largely consists of individuals who are not fluent in English
(Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:sampleNonResponseHealthPlan">1.8</a>). Such <strong>non-response bias</strong> can skew results; generalizing from an unrepresentative sample may likely lead to incorrect conclusions about a population.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Sampling methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-methods"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If data are not sampled from a population at random, these statistical methods – calculating estimates and errors associated with estimates – are not reliable. Four random sampling methods are discussed in this section: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling.</p>
<p>In a <strong>simple random sample</strong>, each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:simplestratified">1.9</a>). Under simple random sampling, each case is sampled independently of the other cases; i.e., knowing that a certain case is included in the sample provides no information about which other cases have also been sampled.</p>
<p>In <strong>stratified sampling</strong>, the population is first divided into groups called <strong>strata</strong> before cases are selected within each stratum (typically through simple random sampling) (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:simplestratified">1.9</a>). The strata are chosen such that similar cases are grouped together. Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest, but cases between strata might be quite different.</p>
<p>Suppose that the health care provider has facilities in different cities. If the range of services offered differ by city, but all locations in a given city will offer similar services, it would be effective for the quality improvement team to use stratified sampling to identify participants for their study, where each city represents a stratum and plan members are randomly sampled from each city.</p>

<p>In a <strong>cluster sample</strong>, the population is first divided into many groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>. Then, a fixed number of clusters is sampled and all observations from each of those clusters are included in the sample (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:clustermultistage">1.10</a>, top panel). A <strong>multistage sample</strong> is similar to a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, a random sample is collected within each selected cluster (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:clustermultistage">1.10</a>, bottom panel).</p>

<p>Unlike with stratified sampling, cluster and multistage sampling are most helpful when there is high case-to-case variability within a cluster, but the clusters themselves are similar to one another. For example, if neighborhoods in a city represent clusters, cluster and multistage sampling work best when the population within each neighborhood is very diverse, but neighborhoods are relatively similar.</p>
<p>Applying stratified, cluster, or multistage sampling can often be more economical than only drawing random samples. However, analysis of data collected using such methods is more complicated than when using data from a simple random sample; this text will only discuss analysis methods for simple random samples.</p>

</h3>
<p>The two primary types of study designs used to collect data are experiments and observational studies.</p>
<p>In an <strong>experiment</strong>, researchers directly influence how data arise, such as by assigning groups of individuals to different treatments and assessing how the outcome varies across treatment groups. The LEAP study is an example of an experiment with two groups, an experimental group that received the intervention (peanut consumption) and a control group that received a standard approach (peanut avoidance). In studies assessing effectiveness of a new drug, individuals in the control group typically receive a <strong>placebo</strong>, an inert substance with the appearance of the experimental intervention. The study is designed such that on average, the only difference between the individuals in the treatment groups is whether or not they consumed peanut protein. This allows for observed differences in experimental outcome to be directly attributed to the intervention and constitute evidence of a causal relationship between intervention and outcome.</p>
<p>In an <strong>observational study</strong>, researchers merely observe and record data, without interfering with how the data arise. For example, to investigate why certain diseases develop, researchers might collect data by conducting surveys, reviewing medical records, or following a <strong>cohort</strong> of many similar individuals. Observational studies can provide evidence of an association between variables, but cannot by themselves show a causal connection. However, there are many instances where randomized experiments are unethical, such as to explore whether lead exposure in young children is associated with cognitive impairment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.6</span> Experiments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experiments"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Experimental design is based on three principles: control, randomization, and replication.</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: When selecting participants for a study, researchers work to <strong>control</strong> for extraneous variables and choose a sample of participants that is representative of the population of interest. For example, participation in a study might be restricted to individuals who have a condition that suggests they may benefit from the intervention being tested. Infants enrolled in the LEAP study were required to be between 4 and 11 months of age, with severe eczema and/or allergies to eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Randomization</strong>: Randomly assigning patients to treatment groups ensures that groups are balanced with respect to both variables that can and cannot be controlled. For example, randomization in the LEAP study ensures that the proportion of males to females is approximately the same in both groups. Additionally, perhaps some infants were more susceptible to peanut allergy because of an undetected genetic condition; under randomization, it is reasonable to assume that such infants were present in equal numbers in both groups. Randomization allows differences in outcome between the groups to be reasonably attributed to the treatment rather than inherent variability in patient characteristics, since the treatment represents the only systematic difference between the two groups.</p>
<p>In situations where researchers suspect that variables other than the intervention may influence the response, individuals can be first grouped into <strong>blocks</strong> according to a certain attribute and then randomized to treatment group within each block; this technique is referred to as <strong>blocking</strong> or <strong>stratification</strong>. The team behind the LEAP study stratified infants into two cohorts based on whether or not the child developed a red, swollen mark (a wheal) after a skin test at the time of enrollment; afterwards, infants were randomized between peanut consumption and avoidance groups. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:leapBlocking">1.11</a> illustrates the blocking scheme used in the study.</p>
<p><strong>Replication</strong>: The results of a study conducted on a larger number of cases are generally more reliable than smaller studies; observations made from a large sample are more likely to be representative of the population of interest. In a single study, <strong>replication</strong> is accomplished by collecting a sufficiently large sample. The LEAP study randomized a total of 640 infants.</p>
<p>Randomized experiments are an essential tool in research. The US Food and Drug Administration typically requires that a new drug can only be marketed after two independently conducted randomized trials confirm its safety and efficacy; the European Medicines Agency has a similar policy. Large randomized experiments in medicine have provided the basis for major public health initiatives. In 1954, approximately 750,000 children participated in a randomized study comparing polio vaccine with a placebo.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Paul Meier and others, “The Biggest Public Health Experiment Ever: The 1954 Field Trial of the Salk Poliomyelitis Vaccine,” &lt;em&gt;Statistics: A Guide to the Unknown.

<p>In observational studies, researchers simply observe selected potential explanatory and response variables. Participants who differ in important explanatory variables may also differ in other ways that influence response; as a result, it is not advisable to make causal conclusions about the relationship between explanatory and response variables based on observational data. For example, while observational studies of obesity have shown that obese individuals tend to die sooner than individuals with normal weight, it would be misleading to conclude that obesity causes shorter life expectancy. Instead, underlying factors are probably involved; obese individuals typically exhibit other health behaviors that influence life expectancy, such as reduced exercise or unhealthy diet.</p>
<p>Suppose that an observational study tracked sunscreen use and incidence of skin cancer, and found that the more sunscreen a person uses, the more likely they are to have skin cancer. These results do not mean that sunscreen causes skin cancer. One important piece of missing information is sun exposure – if someone is often exposed to sun, they are both more likely to use sunscreen and to contract skin cancer (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:confounding">1.12</a>). Sun exposure is a <strong>confounding variable</strong>: a variable associated with both the explanatory and response variables (also called a <strong>lurking variable</strong>, <strong>confounding factor</strong>, or a <strong>confounder</strong>). There is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured; as a result, it is not advisable to draw causal conclusions from observational studies.</p>

<p>Confounding is not limited to observational studies. For example, consider a randomized study comparing two treatments (varenicline and buproprion) against a placebo as therapies for aiding smoking cessation.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Douglas E Jorenby et al., “Efficacy of Varenicline, an &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\beta\)&lt;/span&gt;2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Partial Agonist, Vs Placebo or Sustained-Release Bupropion for Smoking Cessation: A Randomized Controlled Trial,” &lt;em&gt;Jama&lt;/em&gt; 296, no. 1 (2006): 56–63.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a></span> At the beginning of the study, participants were randomized into groups: 352 to varenicline, 329 to buproprion, and 344 to placebo. Not all participants successfully completed the assigned therapy: 259, 225, and 215 patients in each group did so, respectively. If an analysis were based only on the participants who completed therapy, this could introduce confounding; it is possible that there are underlying differences between individuals who complete the therapy and those who do not. Including all randomized participants in the final analysis maintains the original randomization scheme and controls for differences between the groups. This strategy, commonly used for analyzing clinical trial data, is referred to as an intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
<p>Observational studies may reveal interesting patterns or associations that can be further investigated with follow-up experiments. Several observational studies based on dietary data from different countries showed a strong association between dietary fat and breast cancer in women. These observations led to the launch of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), a large randomized trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). In the WHI, women were randomized to standard versus low fat diets, and the previously observed association was not confirmed.</p>
<p>Observational studies can be either prospective or retrospective. A <strong>prospective study</strong> identifies participants and collects information at scheduled times or as events unfold. For example, in the <a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/">Nurses’ Health Study</a>, researchers recruited registered nurses beginning in 1976 and collected data through administering biennial surveys; data from the study have been used to investigate risk factors for major chronic diseases in women. <strong>Retrospective studies</strong> collect data after events have taken place, such as from medical records. Some datasets may contain both retrospectively- and prospectively-collected variables. The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) enrolled participants with lung or colorectal cancer, collected information about diagnosis, treatment, and previous health behavior, but also maintained contact with participants to gather data about long-term outcomes.<span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;John Z Ayanian et al., “Understanding Cancer Treatment and Outcomes: The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium,” &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/em&gt; 22, no. 15 (2004): 2992–6.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

</h3>
<p>The <strong>mean</strong>, sometimes called the average, is a measure of center for a <strong>distribution</strong> of data. To find the average clutch volume for the observed egg clutches, add all the clutch volumes and divide by the total number of clutches. For computational convenience, the volumes are rounded to the first~decimal.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overline{y} = \frac{177.8 + 257.0 + \cdots + 933.3}{431} = 882.5\ \textrm{mm}^{3}.
\]</span>
The sample mean is often labeled <span class="math inline">\(\overline{y}\)</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the mean of the entire population from which the sample is drawn. The letter <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest, <code>clutch.volume</code>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-1" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.1  (Mean) </strong></span>The sample mean of a numerical variable is the sum of the values of all observations divided by the number of observations:

where <span class="math inline">\(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n\)</span> represent the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observed values.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>median</strong> is another measure of center; it is the middle number in a distribution after the values have been ordered from smallest to largest. If the distribution contains an even number of observations, the median is the average of the middle two observations. There are 431 clutches in the dataset, so the median is the clutch volume of the <span class="math inline">\(216^{th}\)</span> observation in the sorted values of <code>clutch.volume</code>: <span class="math inline">\(831.8\ \textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The spread of a distribution refers to how similar or varied the values in the distribution are to each other; i.e., whether the values are tightly clustered or spread over a wide range.</p>
<p>The standard deviation for a set of data describes the typical distance between an observation and the mean. The distance of a single observation from the mean is its <strong>deviation</strong>. Below are the deviations for the <span class="math inline">\(1^{st}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^{nd}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3^{rd}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(431^{st}\)</span> observations in the <code>clutch.volume</code> variable.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
y_1-\overline{y} &amp;= 177.8 - 882.5 = -704.7 \hspace{5mm}\text{ } \\
y_2-\overline{y} &amp;= 257.0 - 882.5 = -625.5 \\
y_3-\overline{y} &amp;= 151.4 - 882.5 = -731.1 \\
&amp;\ \vdots \\
y_{431}-\overline{y} &amp;= 933.2 - 882.5 = 50.7
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The sample <strong>variance</strong>, the average of the squares of these deviations, is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
s^2 &amp;= \frac{(-704.7)^2 + (-625.5)^2 + (-731.1)^2 + \cdots + (50.7)^2}{431-1} \\

&amp;= 143,680.9.
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The denominator is <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>; this mathematical nuance accounts for the fact that sample mean has been used to estimate the population mean in the calculation. Details on the statistical theory can be found in more advanced texts.</p>
<p>The sample <strong>standard deviation</strong> <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the square root of the variance:
<span class="math display">\[s=\sqrt{143,680.9} = 379.05 \textrm{mm}^{3}.\]</span></p>
<p>Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation are denoted by Greek letters:
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{}^2\)</span> for the variance and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the standard deviation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-2" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.2  (Standard Deviation) </strong></span>The sample standard deviation of a numerical variable is computed as the square root of the variance, which is the sum of squared deviations divided by the number of observations minus 1.

\end{eqnarray}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n\)</span> represent the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observed values.</p>
</div>
<p>Variability can also be measured using the <strong>interquartile range</strong> (IQR). The IQR for a distribution is the difference between the first and third quartiles: <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 - Q_1\)</span>. The first quartile (<span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>) is equivalent to the 25<span class="math inline">\(^{th}\)</span> percentile; i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value. The third quartile (<span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>) is equivalent to the 75<span class="math inline">\(^{th}\)</span> percentile. By definition, the median represents the second quartile, with half the values falling below it and half falling above. The IQR for <code>clutch.volume</code> is <span class="math inline">\(1096.0 - 609.6 = 486.4\ \textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Measures of center and spread are ways to summarize a distribution numerically. Using numerical summaries allows for a distribution to be efficiently described with only a few numbers. Numerical summaries are also known as summary statistics. For example, the calculations for <code>clutch.volume</code> indicate that the typical egg clutch has volume of about 880 mm<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>, while the middle <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> of egg clutches have volumes between approximately <span class="math inline">\(600\ \textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1100.0\ \textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Graphs show important features of a distribution that are not evident from numerical summaries, such as asymmetry or extreme values. While dot plots show the exact value of each observation, histograms and boxplots graphically summarize distributions.</p>
<p>In a <strong>histogram</strong>, observations are grouped into bins and plotted as bars. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogBinnedClutchVolTable">1.15</a> shows the number of clutches with volume between 0 and 200 <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>, 200 and 400 <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>, etc. up until 2,600 and 2,800 <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{mm}^{3}\)</span>. Note: By default in <code>R</code>, the bins are left-open and right-closed; i.e., the intervals are of the form (a, b]. Thus, an observation with value 200 would fall into the 0-200 bin instead of the 200-400 bin.} These binned counts are plotted in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogHist">1.16</a>.</p>

<p>Histograms provide a view of the <strong>data density</strong>. Higher bars indicate more frequent observations, while lower bars represent relatively rare observations. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogHist">1.16</a> shows that most of the egg clutches have volumes between 500-1,000 mm<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span>, and there are many more clutches with volumes smaller than 1,000 mm<span class="math inline">\(^{3}\)</span> than clutches with larger volumes.</p>
<p>Histograms show the <strong>shape</strong> of a distribution. The tails of a <strong>symmetric</strong> distribution are roughly equal, with data trailing off from the center roughly equally in both directions. Asymmetry arises when one tail of the distribution is longer than the other. A distribution is said to be <strong>right skewed</strong> when data trail off to the right, and <strong>left skewed</strong> when data trail off to the left. Other ways to describe data that are skewed to the right/left: skewed to the right/left or skewed to the positive/negative end. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogHist">1.16</a> shows that the distribution of clutch volume is right skewed; most clutches have relatively small volumes, and only a few clutches have high volumes.</p>
<p>A <strong>mode</strong> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. Another definition of mode, which is not typically used in statistics, is the value with the most occurrences. It is common that a dataset contains no observations with the same value, which makes this other definition impractical for many datasets. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:singleBiMultiModalPlots">1.17</a> shows histograms that have one, two, or three major peaks. Such distributions are called <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>bimodal</strong>, and <strong>multimodal</strong>, respectively. Any distribution with more than two prominent peaks is called multimodal. Note that the less prominent peak in the unimodal distribution was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations. Prominent is a subjective term, but it is usually clear in a histogram where the major peaks are.</p>

However, there was no clutch with volume 1,826.1 <span class="math inline">\(\textrm {mm}^{3}\)</span>; thus, the upper whisker extends to 1,819.7 <span class="math inline">\(\textrm {mm}^{3}\)</span>, the largest observation that is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span>.</p>
<p>Any observation that lies beyond the whiskers is shown with a dot; these observations are called outliers. An <strong>outlier</strong> is a value that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data. For the <code>clutch.volume</code> variable, there are several large outliers and no small outliers, indicating the presence of some unusually large egg clutches.</p>
<p>The high outliers in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogBoxPlot">1.18</a> reflect the right-skewed nature of the data. The right skew is also observable from the position of the median relative to the first and third quartiles; the median is slightly closer to the first quartile. In a symmetric distribution, the median will be halfway between the first and third quartiles.</p>

<p>When working with strongly skewed data, it can be useful to apply a <strong>transformation</strong>, and rescale the data using a function. A natural log transformation is commonly used to clarify the features of a variable when there are many values clustered near zero and all observations are positive.</p>

</div>
<p>For example, income data are often skewed right; there are typically large clusters of low to moderate income, with a few large incomes that are outliers. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:incomeHistReg">1.19</a> shows a histogram of average yearly per capita income measured in US dollars for 165 countries in 2011. The data are available as <code>wdi.2011</code> in the <code>R</code> package <code>oibiostat</code>. The data are heavily right skewed, with the majority of countries having average yearly per capita income lower than $10,000. Once the data are log-transformed, the distribution becomes roughly symmetric (Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:incomeHistLog">1.20</a>). In statistics, the natural logarithm is usually written <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span>. In other settings it is sometimes written as <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span>.</p>
<p>For symmetric distributions, the mean and standard deviation are particularly informative summaries. If a distribution is symmetric, approximately 70% of the data are within one standard deviation of the mean and 95% of the data are within two standard deviations of the mean; this guideline is known as the <strong>empirical rule</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-3" class="example"><strong>Example 1.1  </strong></span>On the log-transformed scale, mean <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span> income is 8.50, with standard deviation 1.54. Apply the empirical rule to describe the distribution of average yearly per capita income among the 165 countries.</p>
<p>According to the empirical rule, the middle 70% of the data are within one standard deviation of the mean, in the range (8.50 - 1.54, 8.50 + 1.54) = (6.96, 10.04) log(USD). 95% of the data are within two standard deviations of the mean, in the range (8.50 - 2(1.54), 8.50 + 2(1.54)) = (5.42, 11.58) log(USD).</p>
<p>Undo the log transformation. The middle 70% of the data are within the range
<span class="math display">\[ (e^{6.96}, e^{10.04}) = (1054, 22925)\]</span>. The middle 95% of the data are within the range
<span class="math display">\[(e^{5.42}, e^{11.58}) = (226, 106937).\]</span></p>

<p>Functions other than the natural log can also be used to transform data, such as the square root and inverse.</p>

<p>In the frog parental investment study, researchers used clutch volume as a primary variable of interest rather than egg size because clutch volume represents both the eggs and the protective gelatinous matrix surrounding the eggs. The larger the clutch volume, the higher the energy required to produce it; thus, higher clutch volume is indicative of increased maternal investment. Previous research has reported that larger body size allows females to produce larger clutches; is this idea supported by the <code>frog</code> data?</p>
<p>A <strong>scatterplot</strong> provides a case-by-case view of the relationship between two numerical variables. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:frogClutchVolBodySize">1.22</a> shows clutch volume plotted against body size, with clutch volume on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis and body size on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. Each point represents a single case. For this example, each case is one egg clutch for which both volume and body size (of the female that produced the clutch) have been recorded.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The plot shows a discernible pattern, which suggests an <strong>association</strong>, or relationship, between clutch volume and body size; the points tend to lie in a straight line, which is indicative of a <strong>linear association</strong>. Two variables are <strong>positively associated</strong> if increasing values of one tend to occur with increasing values of the other; two variables are <strong>negatively associated</strong> if increasing values of one variable occurs with decreasing values of the other. If there is no evident relationship between two variables, they are said to be <strong>uncorrelated</strong> or <strong>independent</strong>.</p>
<p>As expected, clutch volume and body size are positively associated; larger frogs tend to produce egg clutches with larger volumes. These observations suggest that larger females are capable of investing more energy into offspring production relative to smaller females.</p>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) consists of a set of surveys and measurements conducted by the US CDC to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The following example uses data from a sample of 500 adults (individuals ages 21 and older) from the <strong>NHANES</strong> dataset. The sample is available as <code>nhanes.samp.adult.500</code> in the <code>oibiostat</code> package.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-4" class="example"><strong>Example 1.2  </strong></span>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight commonly used by health agencies to assess whether someone is overweight, and is calculated from height and weight. Describe the relationships shown in Figures <a href="introdata.html#fig:nhanesHeightWeight">1.23</a> and <a href="introdata.html#fig:nhanesHeightBMI">1.24</a>. Why is it helpful to use BMI as a measure of obesity, rather than weight?
<span class="math display">\[BMI = \dfrac{weight_{kg}}{height^{2}_m} = \dfrac{weight_{lb}}{height^{2}_{in}} \times 703\]</span></p>
<p>Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:nhanesHeightWeight">1.23</a> shows a positive association between height and weight; taller individuals tend to be heavier. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:nhanesHeightBMI">1.24</a> shows that height and BMI do not seem to be associated; the range of BMI values observed is roughly consistent across height.</p>
<p>Weight itself is not a good measure of whether someone is overweight; instead, it is more reasonable to consider whether someone’s weight is unusual relative to other individuals of a comparable height. An individual weighing 200 pounds who is 6 ft tall is not necessarily an unhealthy weight; however, someone who weighs 200 pounds and is 5 ft tall is likely overweight. It is not reasonable to classify individuals as overweight or obese based only on weight.</p>
<p>BMI acts as a relative measure of weight that accounts for height. Specifically, BMI is used as an estimate of body fat. According to US National Institutes of Health (US NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI between 25.0 - 29.9 is considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is considered obese.</p>

Life expectancy is measured as the expected lifespan for children born in 2011 and income is adjusted for purchasing power in a country. Describe the relationship between life expectancy and annual per capita income; do they seem to be linearly associated?</p>
<p>Life expectancy and annual per capita income are positively associated; higher per capita income is associated with longer life expectancy. However, the two variables are not linearly associated. When income is low, small increases in per capita income are associated with relatively large increases in life expectancy. However, once per capita income exceeds approximately $20,000 per year, increases in income are associated with smaller gains in life expectancy.</p>
<p>In a linear association, change in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-variable for every unit of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable is consistent across the range of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable; for example, a linear association would be present if an increase in income of $10,000 corresponded to an increase in life expectancy of 5 years, across the range of income.</p>

<p>Correlation is a numerical summary statistic that measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. It is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, which takes on values between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>If the paired values of two variables lie exactly on a line, <span class="math inline">\(r = \pm 1\)</span>; the closer the correlation coefficient is to <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>, the stronger the linear association. When two variables are positively associated, with paired values that tend to lie on a line with positive slope, <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; 0\)</span>. If two variables are negatively associated, <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; 0\)</span>. A value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that is 0 or approximately 0 indicates no apparent association between two variables.If paired values lie perfectly on either a horizontal or vertical line, there is no association and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is mathematically undefined.</p>
<p>The correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of a linear trend. Prior to calculating a correlation, it is advisable to confirm that the data exhibit a linear relationship. Although it is mathematically possible to calculate correlation for any set of paired observations, such as the life expectancy versus income data in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:incomeLifeExpectancy">1.25</a>, correlation cannot be used to assess the strength of a nonlinear relationship.</p>

<p>Like relative frequency tables for the distribution of one categorical variable, contingency tables can also be converted to show proportions. Since there are two variables, it is necessary to specify whether the proportions are calculated according to the row variable or the column variable.</p>

<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-9" class="example"><strong>Example 1.6  </strong></span>For African Americans in the study, CC is the most common genotype and TT is the least common genotype. Does this pattern hold for the other races in the study? Do the observations from the study suggest that distribution of genotypes at r577x vary between populations?</p>
<p>The pattern holds for Asians, but not for other races. For the Caucasian individuals sampled in the study, CT is the most common genotype at 46.3%. CC is the most common genotype for Asians, but in this population, genotypes are more evenly distributed: 38.2% of Asians sampled are CC, 32.7% are CT, and 29.1% are TT. The distribution of genotypes at r577x seems to vary by population.</p>

<p><span id="exr:unlabeled-div-10" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 1.1  </strong></span>As shown in Table <a href="introdata.html#tab:famussColPropTable">1.6</a>, 72.3% of CC individuals in the study are Caucasian. Do these data suggest that in the general population, people of CC genotype are highly likely to be Caucasian?</p>
<p>No, this is not a reasonable conclusion to draw from the data. The high proportion of Caucasians among CC individuals primarily reflects the large number of Caucasians sampled in the study – 78.5% of the people sampled are Caucasian. The uneven representation of different races is one limitation of the <code>famuss</code> data.</p>

<p>A <strong>segmented bar plot</strong> is a way of visualizing the information from a contingency table. Figures <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarA">1.29</a> and <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarStaA">1.30</a> graphically displays the data from Table <a href="introdata.html#tab:famussContingencyTable">1.4</a>; each bar represents a level of <code>actn3.r577x</code> and is divided by the levels of <code>race</code>. Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarStaA">1.30</a> uses the row proportions to create a standardized segmented bar plot.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the data can be organized as shown in Figures <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarB">1.31</a> and <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarStaB">1.32</a>, with each bar representing a level of <code>race</code>. The standardized plot is particularly useful in this case, presenting the distribution of genotypes within each race more clearly than in Figure <a href="introdata.html#fig:famussSegBarB">1.31</a>.</p>
